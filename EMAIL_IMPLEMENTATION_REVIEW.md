## 💡 Pro Tips:

3. Click "Test it" button
4. Fill in test values
5. Send test email

### 3. Email Delivery

## 🔒 Security Notes:

✅ **Public Key is Safe**
- Public keys are meant to be public
- They're exposed in frontend code
- EmailJS has rate limiting to prevent abuse

⚠️ **Keep Service ID & Template ID Safe**
- Don't share them publicly in blogs/forums
- They're visible in your code (that's ok)
- EmailJS dashboard controls who can use them

---

## 📊 Email Analytics (Optional Future Enhancement):

Consider tracking:
- Number of contact form submissions
- Response time
- Most common inquiries
- Conversion rate (contacts → opportunities)

---
